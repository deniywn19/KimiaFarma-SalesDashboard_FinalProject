## Project Background 
Kimia Farma is the first pharmaceutical industry company in Indonesia which was founded by the Dutch East Indies Government in 1817. As a Big Data Analyst Intern who already understands the sales data for each Brand at Kimia Farma, I was asked to make a dashboard of sales data in one year from the raw data that has been provided. To test my understanding, it is necessary to process the data from beginning to end.
